# Networking Basics #1: Exploring IP Addresses and Bash Scripting

In this insightful project, my journey into the realm of networking advanced, focusing on the intricacies of IP addresses while honing my skills in manipulating them through the power of Bash scripts. With each task, I delved deeper into the core concepts, unraveling the mysteries of network configuration and port handling.

## Tasks Overview üìÉ

### Task 0: Change Your Home IP (0-change_your_home_IP)
In this task, I crafted a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server, transforming it into a digital maestro. The script accomplished the following feats:
- Resolved `localhost` to `127.0.0.2`, enhancing the local loopback address.
- Transmuted `facebook.com` into `8.8.8.8`, shaping the way the server perceives this renowned digital domain.

### Task 1: Show Attached IPs (1-show_attached_IPs)
In this endeavor, I created a dynamic Bash script capable of peering into the digital landscape, revealing all active IPv4 addresses adorning the machine. This script provided valuable insights into the network's active entities, enhancing my understanding of the connected environment.

### Task 2: Port Listening on Localhost (100-port_listening_on_localhost)
In this task, I engineered a Bash script with finesse, orchestrating the machine to listen attentively on port 98 within the confines of `localhost`. This script not only showcased my prowess in port handling but also fortified my ability to control network interactions.

With each task, I embraced the challenges and triumphs, strengthening my grasp on IP addresses and Bash scripting. As I navigated the intricate pathways of networking basics, I solidified my foundation, paving the way for further exploration in the boundless realms of technology. The journey continues, and I eagerly anticipate the discoveries that await in the ever-evolving landscape of networking. üåê‚ú®
